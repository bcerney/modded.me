    For how much longer will you put off
    valuing yourself worthy of the best
    and in nothing step over logical distinctions?
    You received the principles with which you should agree,
    and you have agreed.
    
    So what kind of teacher are you still expecting,
    that you postpone for that
    making corrections of yourself?
    
    You are no longer a boy, but already a grown man.
    If now you are careless and take it easy
    and always make advances out of advancement
    and schedule for other days upon other days,
    after which you will pay attention to yourself,
    escaping yourself you will not progress,
    but you will continue in mediocrity both living and dying.
    
    So already value your life as perfect and progress;
    and let everything appearing best to you be unchangeable law.
    And if you meet anything laborious or sweet
    or notable or unnotable,
    remember that now is the contest
    and already present are the Olympics
    and it is not possible to put it off any longer
    and that on a single day and in one matter
    progress is both lost and saved.
    
    Thus Socrates became accomplished,
    by paying attention in every encounter of his
    to nothing else but reason.
    And even if you are not yet a Socrates,
    as one wishing to be a Socrates you ought to live.

    - `Epictetus, Manual 51 <http://san.beck.org/Epictetus.html#51>`_

The Roman philosopher Seneca said it well in a letter to Paulinus:

    It is not that we have a short space of time, but that we waste much of it. Life is long enough, and it has been given in sufficiently generous measure to allow the accomplishment of the very greatest things if the whole of it is well invested. But when it is squandered in luxury and carelessness, when it is devoted to no good end, forced at last by the ultimate necessity we perceive that it has passed away before we were aware that it was passing.So it is—the life we receive is not short, but we make it so, nor do we have any lack of it, but are wasteful of it.

    […]

    I cannot doubt the truth of that utterance which the greatest of poets delivered with all the seeming of an oracle: “The part of life we really live is small.” For all the rest of existence is not life, but merely time. Vices beset us and surround us on every side, and they do not permit us to rise anew and lift up our eyes for the discernment of truth, but they keep us down when once they have overwhelmed us and we are chained to lust. Their victims are never allowed to return to their true selves; if ever they chance to find some release, like the waters of the deep sea which continue to heave even after the storm is past, they are tossed about and no rest from their lusts abides.
